Replacements for Unidentified Items, these do not require an identity tome to unlock, instead they require an item sacrifice to unlock. The spirits may reject your offering and burn the items you sacrifice to ash. The higher the tier of the item you sacrifice, the better the chance of getting a better item, and the lower the chance of turning to ash.

Relics have a chance of dropping from the more difficult mobs. They will only give you an item that is tier Junk, Ordinary, Unusual or Rare. Artifact items have NOT been added to the game yet as they still require balancing and I want to make more artifact effects for certain items that currently only have effects with very specific uses (If you have ever wanted a custom enchantment on your item and think you have a good idea for one, this is your chance to get it in the game so please message me.)
