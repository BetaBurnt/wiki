## Recycle Bins

Note that these are mostly decorative and easier ways of using `/bin` as you just need to click the block, not type a command!

To craft simply follow this guide but for the colour you wish to use (replace the dye - no dye = white):

Note that there are 3 effects for chimneys - Nether based chimneys get the flame under the smoke, the End Brick Chimney gets a purple spiral around the smoke. All others are just smoke.

To craft simply follow this guide but for the material you wish to use (replace the cobble):

To craft simply follow this guide but replace the stained glass panes for the colour of tealight holder you wish to use! (and yes - they give off a little light. Mood lighting!)

### Lanterns

To craft simply follow this guide but replace the stained glass panes for the colour of lantern holder you wish to use! Note that there is no black lantern but all other colours work! (As with tealight - they give off light. But way more!)

### Clocks

![clock list](https://i.gyazo.com/07273837c127c9d5a03b2fb56b4de1a6.png)

These will allow you to check both the servers current time, and the time of the next world resets! Right click to check server time, and sneak right click to check the time worlds will reset and whether the End is open or closed! 
Please note that due to limits in Skript at the moment (may be able to find a work around at a later date but it's very low priority) the reset dates are set by me manually so they won't change instantly when the worlds reset! I will try and keep them up to date however (along with the channel on Discord).

![clock recipe](http://minecraftrecipedesigner.com/creations/235903.png)

Add the dye you wish to use in the bottom middle slot to change the colour of the clock - with no dye it will be white!


**Note::** You can get the chimneys, tealights and lanterns while in creative with `/deco`!
Clocks and Recycle Bins currently cannot be gotten in Creative, as they're more for the utility than the effects.
