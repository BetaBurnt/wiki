# MythicDrops

MythicDrops is the plugin used to handle weapon/tool/armour drops from mob kills that gives a bit of variety to what you can find. For example you'll commonly come across items with no to one or two low level enchants in the Junk and Uncommon tier, for example:

![junk](images/junk.png)

The item tiers in general go:
- Junk
- Common
- Rare > Artisan
- Epic > Exotic
- Legendary

Each tier has different amounts of potential enchantments and how many enchantments they can spawn with, and a different amount of potential empty cores (see below).

Artisan and Exotic are slightly more common to find than their equivalent normalk tier (Rare and Epic respectively) but they will also come with Curse of Vanishing as standard and a slightly lower top level for some enchants etc.. (ie they are as good as most of the drops from their respective normal tier, will drop more regularly but will also be lost if you die with them in your inventory).

For example, you may find an Artisan item such as this:

![artisan](images/artisan.png)

And then the Legendary rank - obviously the rarest and best you can find via mob drops. As an example you may find this:

![legendary](images/legendary.png)


Each tier has different potential item drops and drops from different mobs - which mobs drop what tier and what tier contains what items you'll have to find out for yourself! As a general example however without ruining everything - you won't get diamond items in the Junk tier, and rarer enemies will only drop rarer tiers (ie if you summon a Wither it will only drop Exotic, Epic or Legendary level items)


# Empty Cores and Spirit Essence

Along with these drops there is a potential for the item to have empty cores - these allow you to attach a Spirit Essence to that item!

There are a number of spirit essences available, ranging from adding an effect when hitting something with your weapon/tool to increasing enchantment levels - all of which will drop as a rare drop when killing any hostile or neutral mobs (ie not farm animals..).

When they drop they will look something like this:

![essence](images/essence.png)

To use them simply pick the item up in your inventory and right click on the item you wish to add it to! The essence will give an indication of what it can be added to in it's lore, in the `Type(s)` line:

![essencelore](images/essencelore.png)

To clarify it'll say either:
- `Armor` - it can be applied to any Helmet, Chestplate, Leggings or Boots.
- `Weapon` - it can be applied to any Sword, Axe, Bow or Trident.
- `Tools` - it can be applied to any Pickaxe, Shovel, Hoe, Fishing Rod or Shears.
- `Bladed-tools` - it can be applied to any Sword or Axe
- `Fortunable-tools` - it can be applied to any Shovel, Pickaxe or Axe.
- If it says something specific it is only for that type of item - for example if it says Boots it can only be used on boots, nothing else.

# Combining Essences

You can now also mix your essences together to make them stronger! Your essences will state if they can be combined (they will have a line in their lore that starts with `Family:`) - to do so you will need 4 of the exact same essence, same family and level. 

When you have your 4 essences, go to `/mdcombiner` (or `/mdc` for short) and click on the chest to open the Combiner!

![combiner](images/combiner.png)

![combinermenu](images/combinermenu.png)

Click the 4 essences in your inventory to add them, and the bottom empty slot in the combiner will change into a nether star to confirm they are okay to merge - click the star to get your upgraded essence!



# Unidentified Items and Tomes -- **DISABLED AGAIN DUE TO THE MOBS-DROPPING-UNIDENTIFIED-ITEMS-OF-WRONG-TIERS ISSUE**

![unidentified](images/unidentified.png)

You may also sometimes come across an item that is Unidentified - To reveal it's secrets you will need to find an Identity Tome! 

The lore of the unidentified item item will state what dropped it and the tiers it can be when revealed! The item **should** be of a tier that the mob that dropped it can give - if not please report it! (This being why it was previously disabled, because simple mobs like Spiders were giving out Legendary loot via unidentifieds...).

![tome](images/tome.png)

Simply pick the tome up in your inventory and right click the unidentified item with it to reveal it!
