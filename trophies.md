Trophies are a new Feature on Legioncraft! They function similarly to achievements, and are awarded to players when they perform certain tasks. You can keep your trophies in your trophy case or place them in the world to show off your achievements to others.

When you unlock a trophy, you will see the following message:

You can use the command `/case` to open your trophy case. All trophies you unlock will be placed into the case. You can only unlock each trophy once.

When you place a trophy down, you can right click it to see who it was awarded to.
