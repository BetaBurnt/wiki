# Basic Teleportation

To teleport to another player you must request it with the `/tpa [playername]` command to go to them, or `/tpahere [playername]` for them to come to you.
The player it is aimed at can then accept it with `/tpaccept` to allow the teleportation, deny it with `/tpdeny`, or simply ignore it!
>Please do not spam people with tp requests - if they have denied it or said no then this will be treated as harassment

## Locations

- `/survival`, `/surv` or `/spawn` will return you to the main spawn point in the Survival world.
- `/creative` will take you to the spawn point in the Creative world.
- `/resources` will take you to the spawn point of the current Resource world.
- `/market` will take you to the entrance of the server marketplace.

## Homes
You can also set up to 3 homes for your own private teleportation spots!
- To set a home teleport use `/sethome [home name]`.
- To go to one of your homes use `/home [home name]`,
- And to delete one? `/delhome [home name]`.

## The End and the Nether

To get to the Nether build a nether portal as normal.
To reach The End, find an end portal in the Resource World. The end is reset every 2 weeks.
