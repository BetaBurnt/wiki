# Basic Teleportation

To teleport to another player you must request it with the `/tpa [playername]` command to go to them, or `/tpahere [playername]` for them to come to you.
The player it is aimed at can then accept it with `/tpaccept` to allow the teleportation, deny it with `/tpdeny`, or simply ignore it!
>Please do not spam people with tp requests - if they have denied it or said no then this will be treated as harassment

## Locations

- `/survival`, `/surv` or `/spawn` will return you to the main spawn point in the Survival world.
- `/creative` will take you to the spawn point in the Creative world.
- `/resources` will take you to the spawn point of the current Resource world.
- `/pawnshop` will take you to the entrance of the servers admin/pawn shop.

## Homes
You can also set up to 3 homes for your own private teleportation spots!
- To set a home teleport use `/sethome [home name]`.
- To go to one of your homes use `/home [home name]`,
- And to delete one? `/delhome [home name]`.

## The End and the Nether

To get to the Nether build a nether portal as normal.
To reach The End, find an end portal in the Resource World. The end is reset every 2 weeks.

## Player Warps

You can now set up to 10 player warps on your Creative plots to allow people to teleport over and view your builds at any time!
To do so stand where you want the teleport to be and do `/pwarp set <name>`, or `/pwarp remove <name>` to remove one you have already set!

You can list all player warps via `/pwarps` and either click the option on the list to go there, or do `/pwarp <teleport name>`!
