# McRPG Skill - Swords

This skill will give you access to various abilities and buffs when using Swords as your weapon!

## How To Increase Your Swords Level?
Somewhat self explanatory... Hit mobs and players with Swords!

## What is the Sword Skills Default Ability?

### **Bleed**.

This gives you a chance to inflict Bleed on a mob/player when hitting them with a sword, and increases the damage Bleed causes slightly.<br>

An entity with Bleed will take damage over time for a short period - however, it cannot kill them.<br>
When a player has been inflicted with Bleed they will have a short period of time after it wears off where they cannot be inflicted with Bleed again.

The chances of Bleed being inflicted goes up as your Swords level goes up (without modifiers from other Swords Abilities).
