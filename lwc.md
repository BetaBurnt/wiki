# Locking your valuables

On LC we use LWC for block protection.

All chests and furnaces that you place will automatically lock to you so that nobody can steal from you!

You can lock a variety of other things too however if you wish, such as doors, gates, trapdoors and most things with an inventory (such as dispensers). To do so do `/lock` and punch it!
To give someone else access to use the chest/door etc.., but keep it locked to everyone else, then while it is locked do `/cmodify [player]` and punch it again!
To unlock something do `/unlock` and punch it! (lots of punching).

You can also set it as a public chest, but still under your protection (so everyone can access, but nobody else can break or lock it) with `/cpublic`.

## Locking Entities

You can currently also lock armor stands and item frames.
If you are locking an item frame make sure to do `/lock` and then **right** click on the frame, as left clicking will pop the frame off the wall (same for `/unlock`)!
