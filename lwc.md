# Locking your valuables

On LegionCraft we use LWC for block protection.

All chests, shulker boxes, item frames and furnaces that you place will automatically lock to you so that nobody can steal from you!

You can lock a variety of other things too however if you wish, such as doors, gates, trapdoors and most things with an inventory (such as dispensers). To do so do `/lock` and punch it!
To give someone else access to use the chest/door etc.., but keep it locked to everyone else, then while it is locked do `/cmodify [player]` and punch it again!
To unlock something do `/unlock` and punch it! (lots of punching).

You can also set it as a public chest, but still under your protection (so everyone can access, but nobody else can break or lock it) with `/cpublic`.
