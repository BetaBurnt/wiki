# Voting

You can vote once per link every 24 hours (once every 12 hours for ServerPact), giving a total of 8 votes per day. 
Every vote you put through rewards you with 1 token for use in the `/tokenshop` which can be traded for a variety of things! Each vote will also count towards your Vote Count Trophy.

Note that you do not need to be online to vote - all votes will process when you do them, and you will be reminded in the chat when you log in next how many tokens you have gained since you were last online!
