# McRPG Skill - Fishing

This skill will give you access to various abilities and buffs while fishing!

## How To Increase Your Fishing Level?
FISH.

## Fishing Treasures

These are split into different groups and rarities, with different abilities increasing the chances of getting them (and adding new items to the treasure pool, which will be noted under that ability), but the main treasures that you can fish up without any specific abilities are (in no order at all):

- Fish (Cod, Salmon, Tropical Fish, Pufferfish).<br>
- Leather.<br>
- NameTags.<br>
- Nautilus Shells.<br>
- Ink Sacs.<br>
- Bones.<br>
- Clay Balls.<br>
- Lapis.<br>
- Iron/Gold Nuggets.<br>
- Rotten Flesh.<br>
- Sticks.<br>
- Bowls.<br>
- Any Coral/Coral Fans.

## Poseidons Guardians

While fishing there is a chance to fish up a Poseidons Guardian.<br>
These have some benefits - killing them grants redeemable experience for your McRPG skills - but they will have boosted stats compared to normal enemies (Drowned to be specific).

The chances of fishing these warriors up increases if you catch multiple fish/treasures in a row in a small area - the more things in a row close to the previous catch the higher the chances become. Spreading each catch out will lower the chances back down again.
