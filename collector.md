# The Collector

![collector1](images/collector.png)

The Collector is a strange being - all he wants are chunks of rocks.... and the occasional soul. In exchange however he has a big warehouse full of excess stock from previous server events and competitions that have not yet been claimed, and a number of other loot/cash to trade for!
You can visit The Collector with `/collect`.

When you right click on him, you will see a menu similar to this:

![collectstore1](images/collectstoremain.png)

Note that if you don't have enough credits for the cheapest item in one of the stores The Collector will lock you out! For example if you have no credits, they will all be locked:

![collectstorelock](images/collectstoremainlock.png)

From here you can sell fragments and souls to him, or trade in your store credit for various loot!

### Fragments/Souls

You can find these items that The Collector covets randomly when mining ores or killing mobs. 
Any ore block has a chance to drop a fragment but **not when silk touched**. Not all mobs have the chance to release a soul that The Collector wants - but we're not going to tell you which do or don't!

You can sell these coveted items to The Collector via the two options to the left of the main store GUI, which will open the following pages:

![collectstore2](images/collectstorefragments.png)<br>
![collectstore3](images/collectstoresouls.png)

When you click any of these options The Collector will have a casual rummage around your inventory and find any of the chosen item and will take them all - you will then be rewarded some store credit!
The amount you will be rewarded for each item is as follows:

|Fragment/Soul Types|Credits Given|
|---|---|
|Coal and Quartz Fragments|1 Token each|
|Iron and Redstone Fragments|2 Tokens each|
|Gold and Lapis Fragments|3 Tokens Each|
|Diamond and Emerald Fragments|4 Tokens each|
|Pitiful and Ordinary Souls|1 Token each|
|Restless and Tainted Souls|2 Tokens each|
|Vengeful Souls|3 Tokens each|
|Exotic Souls|4 Tokens each|
|Pure Souls|5 Tokens each|
|Unique Souls|10 Tokens each|

Once you've traded in some fragments/souls and have gained some credit you can then purchase titles, costumes, items and mob drops from previous events and competitions - **all items in the store are 25 tokens unless they're newly added from the last event/competition, in which case they will be 50!** 
(currently all are 25 tokens, after the next competition for example the titles from that competition will be 50 until the next event/competition etc...)

**Note::** Reward items from builkd competitions (such as the everlasting water jug) will **not** be given as rewards from The Collector - all event items/titles etc.. will be added, and the titles from competitions will be added. Brew recipes from events/competitions will also not be added.



Currently you have the option to purchase the titles from the **Black Magic** and **Winter Getaway** build competitions, and the titles/mob drops/costumes and other items from the **Halloween 2019** and **Winter 2019** events!
