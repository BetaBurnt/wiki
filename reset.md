# Server Reset

The poll on whether the reset happens or not, and when if so, has ended! The results were pretty one sides in favour of a reset (6 against to 25 for the reset) and the votes for the reset were in favour of a reset for 1.16, making it sooner rather than later (which from my end, is better).

This means that the likely time frame for the reset to happen is **August/September 2020**. It may be later than this if plugins take too long updating, but at the very earliest it will be August.

A couple of things to note for LC2 prior to the reset:<br>
- All bans will carry over, and the rules won't be changed prior to the reset in any way (having a shelf life for the current server does not mean you are free to break our rules).
- The hourly job limit on income has been disabled so if you wish to grind like a madman for the player levels prior to the reset feel free to do so.
- Voting will be disabled on June 1st when the May top voters are tallied, as voting bumps adverts and at that point new players will have less and less time to do anything on the server before the reset (all adverts will be updated to state there is a planned reset coming up when I disable voting on them). As such this is the last chance to get top voter rewards, such as the top voter donation store coupon (as all dono stuff will carry over) prior to the reset!
- To go into the above note - when voting has been disabled all players will be given 7 tokens once a day on log in so if you wanted to grab anything from the token shop for the time you have left on LC2 you can still save up for them.


There is still plenty of time with the server as it is, and any builds you want to continue with in Creative or have a schematic sent to you for use on singleplayer or whatever can be sorted post-reset (the current server will be launched separately so you can go on and ticket any builds you need a schematic for) but they won't be carried over to the new Survival.

Also - as we've had the same spawn for a long while... If someone wants to apply for Builder so when we get to reset times a new spawn could be built.... Please feel free ;) Apply [HERE](https://lc-forums.enjin.com/home/m/51940343/viewforum/9622123)!


### Why is a Reset Happening?

The server has stagnated. No server can remain the same forever, same as no server can just endlessly keep adding more and more to the server - it causes issues long-term.
We are at a point where we have had essentially the same core features and how they work and the same rules for 3 different servers (ATC/LC1/LC2), it's time for a change. This doesn't mean a completely different server - a lot of what we have now would remain because it's fun and works well overall - but we have a lot we don't need, a fair few things that aren't even close to "Survival" when that's the main theme of the server, and it's become way too easy to get all of the stuff and run out of things to do.

As it is if the server is not reworked it will get to a point of only being online because donations are allowing it to be, and once they run out bam bye bye LC - again. Not only because new players are no longer a thing (literally maybe 1 in every 70-odd that joins right now is actually staying on and of those that are staying on not that many are staying long-term) and eventually the donations will dry up as we cannot expect the same people to continuously contribute forever... - but also because I physically can't just keep adding things to the server without causing issues, everything I add right now ends up conflicting with something else because of how much there is, the number of issues has started to rise considerably because of how much there is on the server that just one plugin update can mess with (and I also have very little time to manage it as how busy work is has also skyrocketed in the last few months) and it's getting to the point where I will end up just leaving the server exactly as it is including not updating plugins for bug fixes because the chances of it breaking is too high. 

A rework means we can remove a load of the bloat and if/when we add more post-reset we can stick to it being more themed towards Survival and/or adding difficulty or endgame stuff for those that do want to grind their life away on the server so they still have things to do etc.. This also means the chances of things breaking are lower because there's less on the server to cause issues, which means I'm also not having a mental breakdown every time something decides to shit itself, which then eats into my desire to even run the server (don't worry, I'm nowhere near the point of saying fuck it... yet.).
Reworking the server however is not really doable if we carry peoples things over - whether that be items, skill evels, player levels, builds etc... if we're going to do a rework it should be a level playing field from the start (partly because it makes no sense to keep those things, partly because some of the changes likely wouldn't work for players who already have X levels or X skills).





I'll keep a note of the potential changes that the reset will come with on this page.
Please note that these are only **potential changes** - they will change here and there between now and any reset happening, as things are suggested or thought of.
As such please do not take what is written on this page as **this is what will happen on the reset**, as it may not be.

# Plugins/Features Currently Up For Removal

- Mending. Yes - most of you will probably blow a gasket over this but this enchantment has been top of my list to get rid off the first chance I get since it was added to the damn game. We have other ways to repair shit that aren't as easily abusable, and it discourages abusing Villagers if it's not there.
- Villager Breeding - This is a thought to stop people abusing Villagers, particularly discouraging farming them in a small area which causes major TPS issues, but it's a secondary thought to both the above and tweaking Villager trades.
- Removal of Reusable SafariNets from the TokenShop (make them a rare reward for build comps or events, keep singleuse in the token shop).
- Removal of Magnet, `/back` and `/fly` from level perks.
- Removal of the ability to silk spawners.
- Removal of a lot of Brewery drinks as we have close to 100... (obviously leave LC2 dono brews).
- Possibly remove MythicDrops - or replace with an alternative (such as MMOItems).
- BetterBanner (increased banner layers).
- BlockParticles (some of the particles used around spawn, can just skript the ones I want anyway...).
- DynMap (for reasons in the changes to rules below).
- ItemMagnet (if removed from leve perks).
- LampControl (the light a redstone lamp without redstone thing - just...use redstone...).
- BottledEXP (just cause, aside from selling the XP bottles, it's kind of moot when you can store the XP via liquid tanks as well)
- MarriageMaster (just... why. You get enough homes, you can already teleport fairly quickly even with needing to approve it, sending an item is a meh thing....).
- ShulkerboxBackpacks (the thing that lets you open shulkerboxes in your hand rather than having to place them to open them).
Skript-related stuff:
- Backpack Blocks (kind of moot, just use the command...)
- Dice Blocks
- Lantern Blocks (somewhat pointless now we have the proper MC lanterns and it's more for Skript to not be checking for)
- All Event related stuff as nobody will have any of it so no need for Skript to be doing any checks or anything for them (any of it could then return for a future event)
- The Collector (as none of the stuff he sells/does will be relevant anymore - will keep him disabled for potential future use though)
- Bookshelves (got plenty of storage options)
- Perk Scrolls (the thing that does all of the scrolls like scratchcards and 1hour boosts to mcmmo XP etc...)
- Rainbow Glass (not used much, less for Skript to be loading and checking for)
- SoberingThoughts
- Pointers
- Bombs
- Some of the LinkedStorage - Cake Tins, Coffee Pots, Cookie Jars, Egg Baskets (ie the non-alchemy related stuff)
**- Baurds Milk.** Fuck Baurd.


# Things Up For Being Changed/Replaced But Not Removed (or not entirely) In The Reset

- mcMMO - This has gotten to be too much of a server staple and while it's fun to use it's becoming too much of a crutch for people to expect things to be how they've been for years. As such this is up for replacement - for a similarly themed skills plugin that works a fair bit differently. You can read up on the potential (very likely) replacement [HERE](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/mcrpg.63020/)!
- MythicDrops - If replaced it'll likely be with MMOItems, which does similar but not quite as OTT. If kept it'll be made to be less common for drops to appear (tool drops, essences are already quite low so they'd probably stay as is) and to also remove the lower tiers that are worthless.
- Locks - Make them lift if a player has not been online for a long time (unsure how long.... but so that a player who has not bothered to come onto the server for a loooong time can be raided if their stuff is in the wilderness).
- Lower initial Town costs (not Nation costs, just the costs to make a town), but make the costs per town level scale up more as more players will be there to help cover it.
- Same for Nation costs as it levels up from having more residents.
- Potential limit on how much you can stick in a town/nation bank, and a limit on your player balance (ie limit of 25million for players as that's the most you should ever need at one time, or a bit more idk).
- Shulker Box recipe to be less easy - maybe use 8 shells not 2 per box, or 4 shells 4 emeralds or something.
- Make Graves have tiers that unlock as a level perk. EG for new players it keeps your hotbar but drops the rest, next level it keeps hotbar and armour safe but drops the rest, next level it picks X amount of your inventory to keep safe too. Top level as it is now.
- Lower Grave times from 20 minutes to either 15 or 10 minutes. More risk of losing shit and a higher sense of urgency to get back to them.
- Move `/tfly` up to a higher level perk. In general move perks that effect gameplay in general to be higher level perks.
- Make the Dragon a bit tougher cause frankly he's a damn pansy (maybe not make it a 100% always going to be tougher thing, just a **you may find a stronger dragon waiting for you** thing - stronger dragon = better drops? idk)
- Lighten the damage done to Elytras from rocket use (as Mending won't be a thing).
- Limit backpacks to be a maximum of 3 rows not 6 at their max perk level.
- [If silking spawners remains, which it's unlikely to] - Limit the amount per chunk further to 4 with a space of 2 between each.
- How often the End resets so there are less shulkers and elytras being funnelled into the player economy - maybe reset once a month instead of fortnight, still keep open for a week? idk.
- Survival Spawn (new one, obviously - if I can get someone to build me one cause I can't build for shit and Cal's on MC-burnout).
- New hidden titles for the new spawn - staff titles will remain - maybe not quite so many.
- Updates to things that haven't had them for a while (mostly skript related shit, like `/menu` and `/guides`).
- Make Creative access a low level perk (likely level 5?) so people can't just join and go e dicks in Creative.


# Things That Will Still Be There In One Form Or Another But Will Be Reset

- All worlds bar Creative - Creative will carry over.
- mcMMO skills (if we keep it, but unlikely).
- Player Levels
- Job Levels
- Player Balances
- Karma


# Things That Will Carry Over

- Anyone with Trusted or Donator ranks will keep them.
- All Donation Shop perks will carry over (including any unused boosters at the time of the reset).
- Staff will remain staff.

Players will also be allowed to carry over a single chest worth of **decorative** items. This can be any form of player/mob/decorative head (including event/build competition heads), banners or maps (so yes, you can keep your munuke-maps)! When the reset is coming up I'll put a note up to stick what you want to keep in a chest and ticket it so I can copy them over!
Costumes that you take over to LC3 will also still retain their skin-altering ability!


# Changes To Server Rules Post-Reset

These are more or less going ahead unless anyone has any MAJOR issue with them, and I mean major.
- Lift no-griefing/raiding rule in Survival for anything not on town land to encourage more Towny usage. **However** - as the keeping survival pretty rule is staying, still not to decimate large areas of Survival unnecessarily, ie don't turn what was a players little shack into a big hole in the floor...
- No sending people money for the purpose of them levelling up faster (ie no high job level players providing the money for others to level up quickly). Your player level, and the perks they give, are supposed to be something **you** earned, not someone earned for you.
- Tweak the PVP/Harassment rules to be less OTT/offputting.
- Client Mod Rule Tweaks - Minimaps and Dynamic Lighting a nono. As DynMap will be gone and griefing will be more of a thing minimaps could be a bit abusable for keeping track of peoples places (and it's already going to be work to make sure people aren't abusing /homes or /pshops for going back to peoples places unfairly) and as far as Dynamic Lighting goes.... Use torches like normal or the flashlight perk.<br>
**Superfarming clarifications/changes (mostly from what ISNT allowed to what IS because it's shorter):** <br>
- All/any forms of AFK farming will not be allowed.
- The only mob farms/grinders that will be allowed are reasonable sized dark room spawners or a simple grinder around a spawner block you've found, but only if you are actively having to kill the mobs yourself (ie they cannot fall onto hopper or go through lava to kill them so you get their drops while AFK next to them, as per the above note on AFK farming).
- Fully automated crop farms will not be permitted (ie they run by themselves in the background so you end up with chests full of crops without actually doing anything yourself), but using redstone contraptions that you turn on to gather stuff quickly and then turn off while you're not there (ie waterfalls to pop wheat off and funnel them into hoppers/chests but that only turn on via a switch, not via a redstone clock or anything)

<br>RE: `Reasonable sized dark rooms` - You need to use some common sense for that realistically but if it's large enough to be spawning hundreds of mobs in a very short time, it's not allowed, and if it requires digging out an area across multiple chunks just for the dark rooms... not allowed (keep it at a reasonable size - ie not 200 blocks wide and 4+ layers high).


# Planned Tweaks To Features/Plugins We Are Keeping

- **ASyncWorldEdit** - will do actions a little faster than before the reset.
- **Brewery** - 92 Brews we have on LC2... so culling them a little bit and tidying them up (all LC2 dono brews will be present still but most of the older/similar brews will be dropped or changed a little, but I will also add some new ones before the reset), mob drop recipes will obvs be edited to reflect this. 
- **Brewery** - If you log out while heavily drunk and don't log back in for a while you may also log in to "wake up" at a random place around spawn (it may repeat spots, but loads of places around the spawn will been set - it just picks between the two closest spots to where you logged out). 
- **Brewery** - Milk will be removed as a means to reduce drunkness. Bread will still be viable, and to add to this so will cookies, baked potatoes, beetroot soup, cooked chicken/cod/mutton/porkchop/rabbit/salmon, steak, mushroom stew, pumpkin pie, rabbit stew and golden/enchanted golden apples. All of these will reduce your drunk level by a certain amount (it also reduces by itself over time) except for Golden Apples and Enchanted Golden Apples which will fully sober you up in one go.
- **Titles** - Title ordering will start with the karma title, then custom/dono titles, then level titles and job titles will be on the end. Probably going to drop hidden titles (or at least have less of them - and if they stay they'll be different ones) and won't be doing them for events/competitions (but may have something else planned for them post-reset).
- **CMI/Sleep** - Night time speed up when players are sleeping will no longer exclude AFK players & the speed that night passes has been dropped (previously it was 10x for one and went up to 40x max - now it's 5x for one and up to 25x max).
- **CMI/Level Perks** - You will start with 2 /sethomes instead of 3, with up to 7 max from level perks. Trusted players will start with 3 (and still up to 7 max from level perks).
- **CMI/Homes** - In theory it should stop you from setting homes in areas you do not have permission to build in (ie not being able to set home in another town). Obviously we physically cannot stop people from setting homes anywhere in the wilderness, whether that be right by a town so they can come and annoy you etc... but if you suspect anybody has done this report it to staff and we'll check into it (as we will now) and if they have we'll remove the home and warn them.
- **CMI/AFK tweaks** - Item pickup will be disabled when AFK as will XP gains (note that when AFK if you would pick up an item it just won't pick up, but for XP it'll vanish due to issues with XP in MC itself), and spawners near an AFK player will not spawn mobs (natural mob spawns will still occur but only because the amount of checks the plugin has to make to prevent that can be a bit much - AFK'ing next to a spawner/dark room etc... to build mobs up is against the rules regardless of whether it happens).
- **CMI/Spawners** - Spawners can no longer be silk touched by anybody but myself (if it's absolutely necessary for some reason), as it's no longer a player perk.
- **CMI/Chairs** - You will only sit on slabs/stairs with a rapid double click (to avoid sitting by mistake).
- **CMI/Totems** - They will still work from anywhere in your inventory, however they have a 5 minute cooldown so you cannot carry loads into a fight with someone and expect them to keep reviving you endlessly.
- **CMI/Staff Shit** - Jails enabled.

This drops the amount of custom recipes the server is handling from 252 to 141... :L<br>
- **Elevators** - Will work with the new 1.16 slabs (blackstone slabs, crimson slabs, warped slabs, polished blackstone slabs & polished blackstone brick slabs)
- **Elevators** - Will ignore some new blocks placed in the two blocks above the elevator along with the stuff it already does (warped/crimson signs/buttons, polished blackstone buttons & soul torches - also added paintings and item frames).
- **Elevators** - Max distance between floors dropped from 36 to 24.
- **Jobs** - Max level capped at 100, rather than 120 as it is now.
- **Jobs/Handyman**:<br>
__Gain__: Villager Trading for Emeralds (as in, if you get emeralds FROM the villager), mining Crying Obsidian and Nether Gold Ore, breaking Crimson/Warped Roots and Nether Sprouts and killing players (small bonus for winning in PVP - nowhere near high enough to encourage people to be annoying about it).<br>
__Loss__: Placing Nether Gold Ore.
- **Jobs/Woodcutter**:<br>
__Gain__: Stripping logs and stems (v v small payout, no XP) and breaking Warped/Crimson Stems.<br>
__Loss__: Placing Warped/Crimson Fungi.
- **Jobs/Miner**:<br>
__Gain__: Mining Ancient Debris, Basalt, Polished Basalt, Blackstone and Crimson/Warped Nylium.<br>
__Loss__: Placing Ancient Debris.
- **Jobs/Digger**: <br>
__Gain__: Breaking Soul Soil, Nether Wart Blocks and Warped Wart Blocks.<br>
__Loss__: Placing Soul Soul.
- **Jobs/Blacksmith**:<br>
__Gain__: Crafting Chains (v small payout, cause easy as hell to do), Respawn Anchors, Lodestones and Netherite Ingots and smelting Netherite Scraps.
- **Jobs/Farmer**:<br>
__Gain__: Breaking Warped/Crimson Fungi, Shroomlights, Weeping Vines and Twisting Vines.
- **Jobs/Hunter**:<br>
__Gain__: Killing Piglins, Hoglins and players (small bonus for winning in PVP - nowhere near high enough to encourage people to be annoying about it).
- **Jobs/WitchHunter**:<br>
__Gain__: Killing Striders, Zoglins (and Zombie Pigmen swapped for Zombified Piglins... obviously...) and players (small bonus for winning in PVP - nowhere near high enough to encourage people to be annoying about it).
- **Jobs/Enchanter**:<br>
__Gain__: Enchanting of Netherite Tools and Armor.<br>
Not sure how Jobs will handle making Netherite stuff yet so we'll have to wait for their actual 1.16 updates for that.
- **LightLevel** - Disabled until level 21.- **LWC** - Locks will now expire if you have not been online for more than 28 days. Locks will also expire if they were on town land and the town died, or that specific chunk of land is unclaimed.
- **LWC** - Nothing will lock automatically on place any more, you will need to `/lock` important things. Per the new grief/raiding rules, if you forget to lock something and it's not on town land it is fair game.
- **LWC** - Added Crimson/Warped Doors, Trapdoors and Gates as lockable blocks.
- **MD** - Lowered chances to get an MD item drop to make them more of a commodity but made it more likely for that drop to be a spirit essence.
- **MD/Tiers** - There is now only Common, Rare, Exotic, Epic, Legendary and Crystalline. Note that the new "Common" is somewhat in line with the old "Rare" - as MD drops will be rarer they don't need to have as much of a chance to be completely naff.
- **MD/Item Drops** - No Wood, Stone and Chainmail items will drop any more, just Iron, Gold, Diamond and now Netherite for the top two tiers.
- **MD/Essences** - Can't do till 1.16 drops but I'll add an enchant-essence for the new Soul Speed enchant. Minor change - essence items will glow.
- **MD/Identifying** - Will remain disabled. Still buggy and doesn't limit drops to the tiers the mob that dropped it is allowed to have (ie a Creeper isn't 100% guaranteed to drop only a Common tier unidentified item when thats the only tier it's allowed to drop).
- **MD/Mobs** - A couple of the overly common mobs have been disabled from dropping MD loot (Zombies, Skeletons, Spiders, Slimes and Magma Cubes - the latter two because while not common per spawn each spawn can be a fair few deaths which each trigger a chance for loot to drop. Also haven't added Striders to those that can drop MD loot but all other 1.16 mobs can).
- **MD/TokenShop** - Will keep the option to buy random MD essences but will no longer have an option to buy tiered items.
- **MD/Rare Loot** - When the dragon is killed it is guaranteed an MD drop same as it currently always has a Legendary drop - but post-reset it'll have a small chance for it to be a Crystalline drop as well (otherwise they can only be gained from events/competitions).
- **MultiVerse** - Scaling from Survival > Survival Nether set to 1:2 and working, nether portals in Survival and Resources set to go to their correct/respective nether worlds only.
- **Shops** - You will be able to create shops in the permanent Survival Nether if you want to build your shop area there (shop teleports can also now be set in this world).
- **Shops/Costs for having Shops** - It will cost $250 to create a shop, and there will be a 10% tax on shop transactions. For example if you buy an item from a shop for $10 the owner of the shop gets $9 of it - sell an item to a shop for $10 you will get $9 of it - and the $1 extra is removed from the server economy.
- **Shops/Limits** - Minimum price, $2.50 (ie the cheapest you'll be able to buy a stack, dirt or otherwise, is $160 - that's still dirt cheap [ha pun], if you think that's unacceptable even for new players, gtfo). Maximum price, $25,000,000 (as that'll be the max player balance).
- **Voting** - Should process the vote **as** you vote, not when you next log in.
- **Voting** - Should also just broadcast that X player voted, rather than both the broadcast and messaging you directly that you voted.
- **Voting** - With the above change you no longer get messages when you next log in to confirm that you voted, so I've set a custom one up that should just tell you that you've received X tokens since you last logged in from voting.
- **World Scaling** - Changed the Resource Nether scaling from the default of 1:8 to 1:4, for reasons in the next change.
- **WorldBorders** - Survival/End borders kept as they are for now (10000/7500), Resource increased from 7500 to 8000, Resource Nether set to 2000 (8000/4 - hence the change of scaling, as a 1:8 scale means the usable resource nether is tiny), Survival Nether set to 5000 (10000/2). Easy to change as we go if needed but should be fine like this.<br>
**TShop Stuff**:<br>
- Added a confirm purchase feature to all shops (some were missing) so nobody can accidentally buy the wrong thing. If you do and confirmed it... tough it won't be refunded, you confirmed it.
- Removed the Shield from the armour shop (partly it was only there for Mending which is disabled).
- Removed Mending from the Elytra, added Unbreaking. Removed Mending from the Crystal Rod.
- Lowered the Unbreaking enchants across the board.
- Removed the Leather and Chainmail armour set options.
- Removed the Emerald tool/weapon sets and rejigged the enchants between the leftover sets.
- Renamed the Tridents from Emerald/Crystal/Ruby to Antique/Obsidian/Crystal to suit the other sets.
- Added a Demonic Armour set. Will be Netherite (currently just a placeholder) and slightly better than the Crystal set. 100 each.
- Added Demonic Tools/Weapons. Will be Netherite and slightly better than the Crystal set. 125 each.
- Lowered Crystal enchants a bit (they will still be very useful items, but need to work in Netherite sets without them being too OTT to make them better than Crystal)
- Removed Reusable SafariNets (will be comp/event reward only).
- Removed Shulker Shells.
- Removed Rainbow Glass Essence.
- VOID Access increased from 6 hours to 8, and it will allow access to **all** VOID options (ie what you would normally get at top level unlocks)
- Added temporary use of `/tfly` for 15 tokens for 1 hour.
- ReturnTickets are now just "DeathPoint Scrolls". These will only take you back to your last recorded death point. Note that if location you died at is not air or water it won't work because the return point is unsafe (the item in the token shop says this - it does also check to the sides of where you died and if it finds air/a safe spot it'll save there as your return point instead).
**TShop/Price Changes**:<br>
__Armour__: <br>
- Iron/Antique Armour set up from 35 to 40.
- Diamond/Crystal Armour set up from 60 to 80 (as Crystal is better than Token, just lacking the empty cores).
- Diamond/Token Armour set down from 75 to 70.
__Weapons/Tools__:<br>
- Iron/Antique set up from 15 to 25 (as it's now in line with the old Obsidian but Iron not Diamond)
- Antique Bow/Crossbow up to 45 tokens.
- Diamond/Obsidian set up from 35 to 45
- Diamond/Token set down from 75 to 70
- Diamond/Crystal set down from 125 to 100 **except** for the Crystal Bow/Crossbow/Fishing Rod as they won't get a Netherite upgrade, and the Crystal Trident which has gone up from 50 to 65 (was the Ruby Trident previously)
__Mob Stuff__:<br>
- Singleuse Net up from 8 to 15 tokens.
- Dragon Breath down from 12 to 8 per bottle.
__Misc Stuff__:<br>
- NameTags and BabyTags dropped from 10 to 7 tokens (note that I will add 1.16 mobs with baby forms to work with the baby tag post-reset).
- VOID Access up from 20 to 35 tokens.
- **Graves** - Set up to only save X items at set levels, tested somewhat and it seems to work right, I'll test more at a later time. Gives a reminder in the grave message when you die that only X of your items were stored in the grave and the rest dropped.
- **Graves** - Removed the hologram with the name as it's not important for people to know who the grave belongs to (and the hologram is why you can't click the grave from above). The particles remain as you can click through them.
- **Graves** - When 1.16 is out so I can do it I'm going to swap the cobblestone wall it uses now out for a blackstone wall.

# Player Suggested Changes For The Reset - And If They're Likely Or Not

**Suggestion:** A Permanent Nether. <br>
**Likelihood:** This is happening. <br>
**Notes RE this suggestion:** <br>
- The permanent Nether will be linked to the Survival world and a temporary Nether will be linked to the Resource world so you will still have one to go destroy. These will be SN and RN (SurvivalNether and ResourceNether) in the chat.
- Scaling will be changed in the permanent Nether. Normally 1 chunk in the Nether is 8 chunks in the Overworld - as this would mean making fast travelling around the Survival world too easy, and also makes setting a world border on the permanent worlds more of a pain in the ass, so this is going to be changed from 1:8 to 1:2 in the Survival Nether (it will stay 1:8 in the Resource Nether).
- Wither Skeletons will not spawn in the permanent Nether (everything else will as normal).
- It will not be allowed to plaster an area in slabs to focus mob spawns in a small location for farming (this will be included in the new rules post-reset as the superfarming rule will be simplified/clarified for a number of things).

**Suggestion:** Removal of VOID and the Combiner. <br>
**Likelihood:** Removal not likely - however changing them likely. <br>
**Notes RE this suggestion:** <br>
I would say no to removal for the primary reason that the level perks are quite limited (at least with non-decorative stuff) and we need things to make the levels something people want to bother with - HOWEVER, we could limit them more. For example we could have them unlock at X level but only for a few of the options they can be used for (primary thought being to not unlock the ability to combine/void things that are mostly used by digger/miners as it'll help slow those jobs a bit better without changing the jobs themselves) and then have more unlock at a higher level.
Also - if these do stay - they will be locked into X items, rather than just keep adding stuff to them, because they do run a lot of checks per option, don't want them to get excessive (likely lock them to two pages of options at most each - or even just lock them to the options they have right now).

If you want to make suggestions drop them in the `#server-reset-discussion` channel on our Discord!
