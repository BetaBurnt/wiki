# Potential Server Reset

You can vote on whether this happens, and if so when it's likely to happen, [HERE!](https://www.strawpoll.me/19891864)

Note that if the reset happens:
- If the reset gets voted in for 1.16 - the time this is likely to happen is **August/September 2020**
- If the reset gets voted in for 1.17 - the time this is likely to happen is **May/June 2021**

There is still plenty of time with the server as it is, and any builds you want to continue with in Creative or have a schematic sent to you for use on singleplayer or whatever can be sorted post-reset (the current server will be launched separately so you can go on and ticket any builds you need a schematic for) but they won't be carried over to the new Survival.

Also - as we've had the same spawn for a long while... If someone wants to apply for Builder so when we get to reset times a new spawn could be built.... Please feel free ;) Apply [HERE](https://lc-forums.enjin.com/home/m/51940343/viewforum/9622123)!


### Why is a Reset being discussed?

The server has stagnated. No server can remain the same forever, same as no server can just endlessly keep adding more and more to the server - it causes issues long-term.
We are at a point where we have had essentially the same core features and how they work and the same rules for 3 different servers (ATC/LC1/LC2), it's time for a change. This doesn't mean a completely different server - a lot of what we have now would remain because it's fun and works well overall - but we have a lot we don't need, a fair few things that aren't even close to "Survival" when that's the main theme of the server, and it's become way too easy to get all of the stuff and run out of things to do.

As it is if the server is not reworked it will get to a point of only being online because donations are allowing it to be, and once they run out bam bye bye LC again. Not only because new players are no longer a thing (literally maybe 1 in every 70-odd that joins right now is actually staying on and of those that are staying on not that many are staying long-term) and eventually the donations will dry up as we cannot expect the same people to continuously contribute forever... - but also because I physically can't just keep adding things to the server without causing issues, everything I add right now ends up conflicting with something else because of how much there is, the number of issues has started to rise considerably because of how much there is on the server that just one plugin update can mess with (and I also have very little time to manage it as how busy work is has also skyrocketed in the last few months) and it's getting to the point where I will end up just leaving the server exactly as it is including not updating plugins for bug fixes because the chances of it breaking is too high. 

A rework means we can remove a load of the bloat and if/when we add more post-reset we can stick to it being more themed towards Survival and/or adding difficulty or endgame stuff for those that do want to grind their life away on the server so they still have things to do etc.. This also means the chances of things breaking are lower because there's less on the server to cause issues, which means I'm also not having a mental breakdown every time something decides to shit itself, which then eats into my desire to even run the server (don't worry, I'm nowhere near the point of saying fuck it... yet.).
Reworking the server however is not really doable if we carry peoples things over - whether that be items, skill evels, player levels, builds etc... if we're going to do a rework it should be a level playing field from the start (partly because it makes no sense to keep those things, partly because some of the changes likely wouldn't work for players who already have X levels or X skills).





I'll keep a note of the potential changes that the reset would come with on this page.
Please note that these are only **potential changes** - they will change here and there between now and any reset happening, as things are suggested or thought of.
As such please do not take what is written on this page as **this is what will happen on the reset**, as it may not be.

# Plugins/Features Currently Up For Removal

- Mending. Yes - most of you will probably blow a gasket over this but this enchantment has been top of my list to get rid off the first chance I get since it was added to the damn game. We have other ways to repair shit that aren't as easily abusable, and it discourages abusing Villagers if it's not there.
- Villager Breeding - This is a thought to stop people abusing Villagers, particularly discouraging farming them in a small area which causes major TPS issues, but it's a secondary thought to both the above and tweaking Villager trades.
- Removal of Reusable SafariNets from the TokenShop (make them a rare reward for build comps or events, keep singleuse in the token shop).
- Removal of Magnet, `/back` and `/fly` from level perks.
- Removal of the ability to silk spawners.
- Removal of a lot of Brewery drinks as we have close to 100... (obviously leave LC2 dono brews).
- Possibly remove MythicDrops - or replace with an alternative (such as MMOItems).
- BetterBanner (increased banner layers).
- BlockParticles (some of the particles used around spawn, can just skript the ones I want anyway...).
- DynMap (for reasons in the changes to rules below).
- ItemMagnet (if removed from leve perks).
- LampControl (the light a redstone lamp without redstone thing - just...use redstone...).
- BottledEXP (just cause, aside from selling the XP bottles, it's kind of moot when you can store the XP via liquid tanks as well)
- MarriageMaster (just... why. You get enough homes, you can already teleport fairly quickly even with needing to approve it, sending an item is a meh thing....).
- ShulkerboxBackpacks (the thing that lets you open shulkerboxes in your hand rather than having to place them to open them).
Skript-related stuff:
- Backpack Blocks (kind of moot, just use the command...)
- Dice Blocks
- Lantern Blocks (somewhat pointless now we have the proper MC lanterns and it's more for Skript to not be checking for)
- All Event related stuff as nobody will have any of it so no need for Skript to be doing any checks or anything for them (any of it could then return for a future event)
- The Collector (as none of the stuff he sells/does will be relevant anymore - will keep him disabled for potential future use though)
- Bookshelves (got plenty of storage options)
- Perk Scrolls (the thing that does all of the scrolls like scratchcards and 1hour boosts to mcmmo XP etc...)
- Rainbow Glass (not used much, less for Skript to be loading and checking for)
- SoberingThoughts
- Pointers
- Bombs
- Some of the LinkedStorage - Cake Tins, Coffee Pots, Cookie Jars, Egg Baskets (ie the non-alchemy related stuff)
**- Baurds Milk.** Fuck Baurd.


# Things Up For Being Changed/Replaced But Not Removed (or not entirely) In The Reset

- mcMMO - This has gotten to be too much of a server staple and while it's fun to use it's becoming too much of a crutch for people to expect things to be how they've been for years. As such this is up for replacement - for a similarly themed skills plugin that works a fair bit differently. You can read up on the potential (very likely) replacement [HERE](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/mcrpg.63020/)!
- MythicDrops - If replaced it'll likely be with MMOItems, which does similar but not quite as OTT. If kept it'll be made to be less common for drops to appear (tool drops, essences are already quite low so they'd probably stay as is) and to also remove the lower tiers that are worthless.
- Locks - Make them lift if a player has not been online for a long time (unsure how long.... but so that a player who has not bothered to come onto the server for a loooong time can be raided if their stuff is in the wilderness).
- Lower initial Town costs (not Nation costs, just the costs to make a town), but make the costs per town level scale up more as more players will be there to help cover it.
- Same for Nation costs as it levels up from having more residents.
- Potential limit on how much you can stick in a town/nation bank, and a limit on your player balance (ie limit of 25million for players as that's the most you should ever need at one time, or a bit more idk).
- Shulker Box recipe to be less easy - maybe use 8 shells not 2 per box, or 4 shells 4 emeralds or something.
- Make Graves have tiers that unlock as a level perk. EG for new players it keeps your hotbar but drops the rest, next level it keeps hotbar and armour safe but drops the rest, next level it picks X amount of your inventory to keep safe too. Top level as it is now.
- Lower Grave times from 20 minutes to either 15 or 10 minutes. More risk of losing shit and a higher sense of urgency to get back to them.
- Move `/tfly` up to a higher level perk. In general move perks that effect gameplay in general to be higher level perks.
- Make the Dragon a bit tougher cause frankly he's a damn pansy (maybe not make it a 100% always going to be tougher thing, just a **you may find a stronger dragon waiting for you** thing - stronger dragon = better drops? idk)
- Lighten the damage done to Elytras from rocket use (as Mending won't be a thing).
- Limit backpacks to be a maximum of 3 rows not 6 at their max perk level.
- [If silking spawners remains, which it's unlikely to] - Limit the amount per chunk further to 4 with a space of 2 between each.
- How often the End resets so there are less shulkers and elytras being funnelled into the player economy - maybe reset once a month instead of fortnight, still keep open for a week? idk.
- Survival Spawn (new one, obviously - if I can get someone to build me one cause I can't build for shit and Cal's on MC-burnout).
- New hidden titles for the new spawn - staff titles will remain - maybe not quite so many.
- Updates to things that haven't had them for a while (mostly skript related shit, like `/menu` and `/guides`).
- Make Creative access a low level perk (likely level 5?) so people can't just join and go e dicks in Creative.


# Things That Will Still Be There In One Form Or Another But Will Be Reset

- All worlds bar Creative - Creative will carry over.
- mcMMO skills (if we keep it, but unlikely).
- Player Levels
- Job Levels
- Player Balances
- Karma


# Things That Will Carry Over

- Anyone with Trusted or Donator ranks will keep them.
- All Donation Shop perks will carry over (including any unused boosters at the time of the reset).
- Staff will remain staff.

Players will also be allowed to carry over a single chest worth of **decorative** items. This can be any form of player/mob/decorative head (including event/build competition heads), banners or maps (so yes, you can keep your munuke-maps)! When the reset is coming up I'll put a note up to stick what you want to keep in a chest and ticket it so I can copy them over!
Costumes that you take over to LC3 will also still retain their skin-altering ability!


# Changes To Server Rules Post-Reset

These are more or less going ahead unless anyone has any MAJOR issue with them, and I mean major.
- Lift no-griefing/raiding rule in Survival for anything not on town land to encourage more Towny usage. **However** - as the keeping survival pretty rule is staying, still not to decimate large areas of Survival unnecessarily, ie don't turn what was a players little shack into a big hole in the floor...
- No sending people money for the purpose of them levelling up faster (ie no high job level players providing the money for others to level up quickly). Your player level, and the perks they give, are supposed to be something **you** earned, not someone earned for you.
- Tweak the PVP/Harassment rules to be less OTT/offputting.
- Client Mod Rule Tweaks - Minimaps and Dynamic Lighting a nono. As DynMap will be gone and griefing will be more of a thing minimaps could be a bit abusable for keeping track of peoples places (and it's already going to be work to make sure people aren't abusing /homes or /pshops for going back to peoples places unfairly) and as far as Dynamic Lighting goes.... Use torches like normal or the flashlight perk.<br>
**Superfarming clarifications/changes (mostly from what ISNT allowed to what IS because it's shorter):** <br>
- All/any forms of AFK farming will not be allowed.
- The only mob farms/grinders that will be allowed are reasonable sized dark room spawners or a simple grinder around a spawner block you've found, but only if you are actively having to kill the mobs yourself (ie they cannot fall onto hopper or go through lava to kill them so you get their drops while AFK next to them, as per the above note on AFK farming).
- Fully automated crop farms will not be permitted (ie they run by themselves in the background so you end up with chests full of crops without actually doing anything yourself), but using redstone contraptions that you turn on to gather stuff quickly and then turn off while you're not there (ie waterfalls to pop wheat off and funnel them into hoppers/chests but that only turn on via a switch, not via a redstone clock or anything)

<br>RE: `Reasonable sized dark rooms` - You need to use some common sense for that realistically but if it's large enough to be spawning hundreds of mobs in a very short time, it's not allowed, and if it requires digging out an area across multiple chunks just for the dark rooms... not allowed (keep it at a reasonable size - ie not 200 blocks wide and 4+ layers high).


# Planned Tweaks To Features/Plugins We Are Keeping

- **ASyncWorldEdit** - will do actions a little faster than before the reset.
- **Brewery** - 92 Brews we have on LC2... so culling them a little bit and tidying them up (all LC2 dono brews will be present still but most of the older/similar brews will be dropped or changed a little, but I will also add some new ones before the reset), mob drop recipes will obvs be edited to reflect this. 
- **Brewery** - If you log out while heavily drunk and don't log back in for a while you may also log in to "wake up" at a random place around spawn (it may repeat spots, but loads of places around the spawn will been set - it just picks between the two closest spots to where you logged out). 
- **Brewery** - Milk will be removed as a means to reduce drunkness. Bread will still be viable, and to add to this so will cookies, baked potatoes, beetroot soup, cooked chicken/cod/mutton/porkchop/rabbit/salmon, steak, mushroom stew, pumpkin pie, rabbit stew and golden/enchanted golden apples. All of these will reduce your drunk level by a certain amount (it also reduces by itself over time) except for Golden Apples and Enchanted Golden Apples which will fully sober you up in one go.
- **Titles** - Title ordering will start with the karma title, then custom/dono titles, then level titles and job titles will be on the end. Probably going to drop hidden titles (or at least have less of them - and if they stay they'll be different ones) and won't be doing them for events/competitions (but may have something else planned for them post-reset).


# Player Suggested Changes For The Reset - And If They're Likely Or Not

**Suggestion:** A Permanent Nether. <br>
**Likelihood:** This is happening. <br>
**Notes RE this suggestion:** <br>
- The permanent Nether will be linked to the Survival world and a temporary Nether will be linked to the Resource world so you will still have one to go destroy. These will be SN and RN (SurvivalNether and ResourceNether) in the chat.
- Scaling will be changed in the permanent Nether. Normally 1 chunk in the Nether is 8 chunks in the Overworld - as this would mean making fast travelling around the Survival world too easy, and also makes setting a world border on the permanent worlds more of a pain in the ass, so this is going to be changed from 1:8 to 1:2 in the Survival Nether (it will stay 1:8 in the Resource Nether).
- Wither Skeletons will not spawn in the permanent Nether (everything else will as normal).
- It will not be allowed to plaster an area in slabs to focus mob spawns in a small location for farming (this will be included in the new rules post-reset as the superfarming rule will be simplified/clarified for a number of things).

**Suggestion:** Removal of VOID and the Combiner. <br>
**Likelihood:** Removal not likely - however changing them likely. <br>
**Notes RE this suggestion:** <br>
I would say no to removal for the primary reason that the level perks are quite limited (at least with non-decorative stuff) and we need things to make the levels something people want to bother with - HOWEVER, we could limit them more. For example we could have them unlock at X level but only for a few of the options they can be used for (primary thought being to not unlock the ability to combine/void things that are mostly used by digger/miners as it'll help slow those jobs a bit better without changing the jobs themselves) and then have more unlock at a higher level.
Also - if these do stay - they will be locked into X items, rather than just keep adding stuff to them, because they do run a lot of checks per option, don't want them to get excessive (likely lock them to two pages of options at most each - or even just lock them to the options they have right now).
