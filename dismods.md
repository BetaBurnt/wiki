# Disguise Modifications

This page will keep a rough list of the modifications each disguise can use. 

To use a disguise modification simply type `/dis <mob/object>` into the chat, put a space and it will list the mods that disguise has. If you put another space it'll bring up the options available for that mod in most cases (if it brings up the mods list again there are no options it's just an on/off thing, and for some it won't react to but they'll be listed below). 

As an example example to be a baby fox you would do `/dis fox setBaby` or to set yourself as a red fox specifically `/dis fox setType RED`.

You can also chain them - so to be a baby fox that is specifically a red fox you can do `/dis fox setBaby setType RED` or to do the same but with the glowing effect `/dis fix setBaby setType RED setGlowing`.

Almost all disguises have 4 base modifications (a few do not - they will state this below if this is the case), with most having extras which will be listed below. These main 4 modifications are:
- `setGlowing` - this will give the disguise the spectral/glowing effect.
- `setBurning` - this will set the disguise on fire.
- `setExpires <time>` - this will set the disguise to automatically turn off after the set time (for example 4min30sec and it'll undisguise you in 4 minutes and 30 seconds).
- `setParticleColor <color>` - this will give the disguise potion effect swirls in the set color (the available colors will be listed in tab completion).

For some modifications you can simply type the setting rather than the setting and the modification. For example you can just do `/dis dropped_item diamond` rather than `/dis dropped_item setItemStack diamond`. There are just too many for me to go through and check them all...

## Minecarts
You will have access to `/dis minecart`, `/dis minecart_chest`, `/dis minecart_tnt`, `/dis minecart_hopper` and `/dis minecart_furnace`. Note that while hopper/tnt/chest minecarts can be used they add no new modifications normal minecart disguises don't already have, and you can set the block the minecart carries anyway.
Mods for `/dis minecart`:
- `setBlockInCart <block>` - set the block the minecart carries (including hoppers, tnt etc... so it can look like the other cart types).

Mods for `/dis minecart`, `/dis minecart_chest`, `/dis minecart_hopper` and `/dis minecart_tnt`:
- `setBlockOffset <value>` - offset the position of the block in the minecart.

Mods for `/dis minecart_furnace`:
- `setFueled` - set the furnace to be lit (this is the only reason it can be used alongside `/dis minecart`, as while that disguise can set the block in it to a furnace, it can't set it to be lit).
- `setBlockOffset <value>` - offset the position of the furnace in the minecart.

Of the 4 main modifications, only `setGlowing` will work with the minecart disguises.

## Item Drops
- `setItemStack <item>` - set the item you appear as.
Of the 4 main modifications, only `setGlowing` will work with dropped item disguises.

## Falling Blocks
- `setBlock <block>` - set the block you appear as.
- `setGridLocked` - change the disguise from being a floating block that follows where you are to a block that shows locked to the block you're stood in and moves to the next block you move to.
Of the 4 main modifications, only `setGlowing` will work with falling block disguises.

## Ender Crystal
- `setShowBottom <true/false>` - set if the base of the ender crystal is shown or not (default is true).
Of the 4 main modifications, only `setGlowing` will work with ender crystal disguises.

## Shulker Bullet
Of the 4 main modifications, only `setGlowing` will work with fallingblock disguises.

### It should be noted that there is a bug currently with the `setRearing` and `setGrazing` mods - they are reversed. If you wish to set your disguise to be rearing, use `setGrazing`.
