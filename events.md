# Active Server Event

## And the Winter/Advent Event is HERE!
This event will end at midnight on December 28th (UTC).

This event is split into a couple of parts - a general daily unlocked reward, an event shop that you can trade in items gained through a few general gameplay actions in exchange for the usual kind of event-shop items and a return of the "ritual altars" (in this case... elf altars...? idk. Altars.).

## Advent Calendar

You may have noticed a certain red clad belly bopping character near the `/spawn` boat pier (if not.... go find him) - he will allow you to open your LegionCraft Advent Calendar and claim daily rewards!
The first day is open right now - each subsequent day all the way up to the 25th will unlock at 10am UTC that day! Each unlock can be claimed from the moment it unlocks until the end of the day on the 28th of December when the event ends, so you don't need to worry about missing any as long as you log in and claim them before the event ends!

The rewards given will vary by day, and I'm not telling you which day each is given, but if you wish to know the full list of things given (ie to check you didn't miss anything when you have collected them all) you can find a full list here: https://pastebin.com/ETigdnsW.

## Advent Shop

One of Santa's Helpers has joined him on his journey, and they are willing to trade store credit for some Winter Collectibles!

These collectibles are `Candy`, `Mistletoe` and `SantaFish`  - these are worth 1, 2 and 3 store credits per item respectively.

Once you have traded some of these goods in and received some store credit you can then purchase from the Helper's stock, which contains the following:

- Titles - 35 Credits Each - Chilly, Gift Wrapped, The Gift of, Roasted, Naughty Listed, Seasonal, Festive, Icy, Ornamental, Tinsel and SugarPlum are available.
- Effect Wands - 30 Credits Each - Same vein as those from the Halloween Event. Caroler, Snow, Fairy Lights, Sparkles and Wet Effect Wands available.
- Costumes - 25 Credits Each - CandyCane, Christmas Groot, Christmas Tree, Grinch, Krampus, Santa Claus, Mrs Claus, Rudolph, Snowman, Gingerbread Man and Star of Bethlehem costumes available.
- Random MD Essence - 80 Credits Each.
- Random MD Legendary - 200 Credits Each - Limited Stock (25 total).
- Drop of Purity - 60 Credits.
- Hex Tag - 20 Credits.

### Candy, Mistletoe and SantaFish - How To Get?

Candy has a chance to drop from the event mobs (see below).

Mistletoe has a chance to drop when breaking any natural leaf blocks.

SantaFish... you fish for...? Duhh ._.

## Event Mobs

There is a chance for any non-spawner/egg spawned Witch/Zombie/Skeleton in the Survival or Resource worlds to be replaced by an event Pillager. 
These Pillagers will have a halo of particles above their head to mark them (if the particles bug and don't bugger off when the mob dies etc.. don't panic! They will be removed on the next server restart), and will have an increase to their health, strength and resistance.

When killed they have a chance to drop either Candy for the Advent Trader shop, or an Unpowered Rune to use on the Event world Altars (see below).

There is also a chance for any non-spawner/egg spawned Creeper in the Resource world to be replaced with an event Snow Golem! These golems won't die in the sunlight/in hot biomes, will cause half a heart of rebound damage to anybody that attacks them (with a chance to also inflict a brief burst of slowness), have increased health and resistance. They will also glow to mark them (though it should be fairly obvious it's an event mob if there's a random Snow Golem wandering around in the Resource world...).

When killed they have a chance to drop either Candy, as above, or a Cracked Bauble to use on the Event world Altars (see below).

## Winter Altars

As with the previous event for Halloween, some magic altars have been unearthed in another realm (possibly part of the same realm The Necromancer created...) that appear to summon Elves to do your bidding.

If you travel to the `/portals` island you will find a different portal has been activated. 
Next to this portal you will find RewardRosie again - clearly the twins like to get involved in current events! - who will again allow you to send your altar items over to the other realm through her chest (Cracked Baubles and Unpowered Runes in this case, but nothing else).

If you travel through the portal you will find yourself in a frozen cavern that was unearthed by some lost archaeologists, which contain a couple of elvish altars. RitualRita will be near the portal to allow you to receive any altar items you have sent over (and to allow you to put any rewards you get from the altars in her chest to be sent through and received from RewardRosie back in our world).

When you have sent some of these items over simply find one of the altars - it should be fairly obvious where they are, look for a spinning ice particle marking where to place your items! Each item type placed has a different potential reward!

Cracked Baubles can contain various everyday server items that you should find useful in your travels - if the Elves are able to safely remove the contents of the cracked bauble without old miseryguts Krampus stepping in!

The Unpowered Runes however have a chance to be powered with 20 different kinds of magic (again, if Krampus doesn't interfere in the ritual!). These possible magics are:

|Rune Magic Type|What It Does|
|---|---|
|Teleportation|- Sneak right click with the rune in hand to record the location you are at.<br>- Right click while not sneaking with that rune in hand to teleport to the recorded location (5 uses per rune)!<br>- Sneak right click again to change the recorded location.<br><br>- **Note that this magic only works in worlds that are high in magical energy due to regularly being refreshed, but that aren't blocked by the anti-magic of the Void!**|
|Snowflakes|- Place down to start a 3 second timer.<br>- Once the timer ends the rune will blast out magic, causing slowness to anything caught in the blast radius (excluding the player who placed it)!<br>- This rune also has a side effect of temporarily freezing any water in the blast radius!|
|Nausea|- Place down to start a 3 second timer.<br>- Once the timer ends the rune will blast out magic, causing nausea to anything caught in the blast radius (excluding the player who placed it)!|
