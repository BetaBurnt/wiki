# Active Competition

You can view a basic rundown (pretty much the same as listed here to be fair... just... smaller) in game via `/events`!

> Please remember that while anybody can join in the competition and try for a prize (as the only guarantee you won't get a prize is if you don't enter!), you cannot use WorldEdit on your plot to aid you in your building until player level 10+!

**Build Competition Theme**: Fireworks!<br>
**Competition Run Time**: November 7th-21st 2020<br>
**The rules/advice for this competition were as follows:**<br>
- You may work alone or in pairs in this competition. Any builds created by a group of 3+ will be not be counted!
- No copying builds from other players or straight from Google/PMC etc...! If you don't make an effort, then you won't win - simple as!
- More detailed builds are preferred over a larger, but plainer build!
- Be creative/Think outside the box! Don't go for the obvious builds that everyone will do for the theme! Multiple build entries of the same thing will make them less likely to place (if they're too similar)!
- When you have finished your build open a /ticket on your plot to confirm entry or you will not be counted!
- Builds have no size limits for this competition and no height limit!

You can build **ANYTHING** you want (as long as it doesn't break the server rules on being offensive etc...) as long as there is an element of "Fireworks" in the build. The more creative the better but anything and everything built will be considered for placement in the Top 3!
