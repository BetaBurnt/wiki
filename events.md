**Build Competition Theme**: Outbreak!<br>
**Competition Run Time**: May 7th-29th 2020<br>
**The rules/advice for this competition were as follows:**<br>
- You may work alone or in pairs in this competition. Any builds created by a group of 3+ will be not be counted!
- No copying builds from other players or straight from Google/PMC etc...! If you don't make an effort, then you won't win - simple as!
- More detailed builds are preferred over a larger, but plainer build!
- Be creative/Think outside the box! Don't go for the obvious builds that everyone will do for the theme! Multiple build entries of the same thing will make them less likely to place (if they're too similar)!
- When you have finished your build open a /ticket on your plot to confirm entry or you will not be counted!
- Builds have no size limits for this competition and no height limit!
