# Money and Jobs

To check your own balance use `/balance`, `/bal` or `/money` (add another player name after to check theirs, eg: `/bal Reysa`).
To give money to another player use `/pay [player] [amount]`.

## Jobs

The easiest way to make money on the server is to get a couple of jobs so that you earn money whilst playing on the server!
You can join up to 2 jobs at a time - note that if you leave one and join another the old job is reset to level 1!

### Job Commands

To view the available jobs ingame do `/jobs browse` and then `/jobs info [job name]` to see what you get paid for by that job!
To join a job `/jobs join [job]`
To leave a job use `/jobs leave [job]`
To check your stats, and how much job exp you need to get to the next job level use `/jobs stats` (when you are in a job `/jobs info [job]` will be updated for the prices you get at your job level!).
