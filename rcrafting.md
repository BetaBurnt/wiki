# New Items
You can find recipes for new items we have added to the server over on **[this page](newcraft.md)** (so as not to make this page excessively large).

## All of these recipes are for Vanilla items that either lack a recipe in the current server version or their current recipes suck for one reason or another so we have tweaked them!

### Shulker Boxes

![sbox](images/sbox.png)

Shulker boxes are **way** to easy to make once you get any End access, which on a multiplayer server is stupid as everybody ends up getting access to them very easily the moment a single player gets to the end.

As such we have tweaked the recipe a little - instead of being 1 chest and 2 shulker shells for a shulker box, it is 8 shells and a chest. This won't make getting them too hard, but will make them a bit less common on the server as they should be (Mojang really never do think about things from an active public servers perspective... ever...).

### Name Tag

![Name Tag](images/nametag.png)<br>
Any type of sign may be used!

### Planks

![Planks](images/planks.png)

You can use any 6 of the same sapling to get their respective block of planks!

### Leaves

![Leaves](images/leaves.png)

You can use any 3 of the same sapling to get 2 of their respective block of leaves!

### Netherwarts

![nwarts](images/nwarts.png)

### Bone Blocks

![bblocks](images/bblocks.png)

There is a loss compared to Vanilla bonemeal > bone block, but less steps to make and less inventory space to mass produce bone blocks.

### Tall Grass and Ferns
