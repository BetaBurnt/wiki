# Server Chat
When you join the server you will automatically be in the Global server chat channel, but there are a number of channels and ways to contact people on the server!


### Messaging and Chat
To private message another player use `/msg [player name] [message]` and `/r [message]` to reply to the last message you received!
To send a message to a player who is offline use `/mail send [player] [message]`.
To read your offline mail use `/mail read` and to clear them when you have read them use `/mail clear`.

To ignore a player who is annoying you use the command `/ignore [player]` - You will no longer see what they are saying in chat! Do it again to lift the ignore.
To see the real username of a player with a nickname use `/realname [nickname]`.
To see when a player was last online use `/seen [player]`.

### Towny Chat Channels
Town, Ally and Nation chat allow for communication between players that are members of either your town, nation or all allied nations. 

To toggle Town chat, simply use `/tchat` or `/tc`. 
For Nation chat, use `/nchat` or `/nc` instead, and `/achat` or `/ac` for Ally Chat. 
The colour of your chat text will change if you are in any channel other than Global, and there will be a tag at the start of the line to state which channel you are in.

You can also use `/tchat [message]` etc.. to send a message to that specific chat channel without toggling them!

To go back to global chat use `/g` (or `/gchat`, `/global` or `/general`) or `/g [message]` to send a message to the global chat without moving to it!

### Party Chat

You can read up on McRPG's Party system and commands [HERE](http://legioncraft.co.uk/wiki/mcrpg.html#parties).

### Titles
Titles allow you to enable a chat prefix for your player - become a Knight, a Wizard or just a Peasant if you really wish.
Many titles are unlocked through levelling up, but others can be found hidden around spawn or won through events/competitions! You can even add your own title by purchasing one in the Donation Store!

You can view your unlocked titles, and change the one you are using, with `/titles`.
