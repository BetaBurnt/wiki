# Levels

Each player has two ladders they can climb on the server - their [server rank](ranks.md) and their player level!

There are 100 player levels that you can advance through using your ingame balance, which can be earned through use of your [jobs](money.md)!
Each level costs a set amount to rank up to (you can't skip levels by paying an excess) with the `/rankup` command, which will tell you how much you need if you do not yet have enough to rank up! The perks you gain along the way are:

>For all heart increases you need to relog when you go up to that level to load the changes!

You can double check the cost to rank up, and perks/titles gained at any level with the `/levelinfo` command ingame!


### Commands 

##### Portable Workbench

`/wbench` (Note that `/wb` and `/workbench` will not work due to other plugins on the server).

##### Backpack

`/bp` or `/backpack`
>Note that items in your backpack do not drop when you die.

##### Bow and Elytra Effects:

`/bmenu` to list the bow effects you have unlocked, choose which to use and/or toggle them on/off! These effects will trail any arrow you fire from a bow or crossbow!

`/emenu` to list the elytra effects you have unlocked, choose which to use and/or toggle them on/off! These effects will trail you while you glide with an elytra!

##### Hats

`/hat` to put the item/block in your hand on your head as a helmet. Note that not all items/blocks are visible on your head, and your helmet is removed for this (you can take it off the same as any helmet).

##### The Combiner

`/combine` will bring up a menu where you can toggle the feature on/off (with the top icon) and enable/disable which of the listed items it will attempt to combine as you pick them up:

![combiner](images/combiner.png)

For example in the above image the Combiner is enabled, and will attempt to combine all of the items listed except for coal, redstone, lapis and bones.

The Combiner will attempt to combine the following if enabled in the above menu:

|Items picked up (amount of)|Combined Output|
|---|---|
|Coal (9)|1 Coal Block|
|Iron Nugget (9)|1 Iron Ingot|
|Iron Ingot (9)|1 Iron Block|
|Gold Nugget (9)|1 Gold Ingot|
|Gold Ingot (9)|1 Gold Block|
|Redstone Dust (9)|1 Redstone Block|
|Lapis Lazuli (9)|1 Lapis Lazuli Block|
|Glowstone Dust (4)|1 Glowstone Block|
|Nether Quartz (4)|1 Quartz Block|
|Diamond (9)|1 Diamond Block|
|Emerald (9)|1 Emerald Block|
|Rotten Flesh (9)|1 Leather|
|Bone (4)|1 Bone Block|

**Note::** This only triggers in the item pick up event - for example if you have the options for combining Iron Nuggets and Iron Ingots enabled, the Ingots you get from picked up Nuggets **will not** combine unless you drop them and pick them back up.


##### The Item Magnet

`/magnet on|off` to toggle the magnet (You can do this through the `/util` menu too).

>When enabled this will cause any item drops within 8 blocks of you to fly towards you - This can be used alongside the Combiner and VOID perks!

##### Flashlight

`/fl` or `/flashlight` to toggle night vision on/off.

##### V.O.I.D.

`/void` will bring up a menu where you can toggle the feature on/off (with the top icon) and enable/disable which of the 9 items it can destroy you want it to:

![voidmenu](images/voidmenu.png)

For example in the above image VOID is enabled, and will delete any Dirt, Cobblestone, Andesite, Diorite, Granite, Red Sand, Sandstone, Gravel and Netherrack I pick up - but will let me collect Stone and Sand.

##### Chat Titles

You will get new titles as you go up the levels, which you can select/change/disable via the GUI brought up with `/titles`!
A full list of the titles currently added through your player levels can be found [here](titles.md)!

#### Upgradable Hoppers

You can read up how to get and use these hoppers [HERE](hopper.md)!
