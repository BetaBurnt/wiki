# Levels

Each player has two ladders they can climb on the server - their [server rank](ranks.md) and their player level!

There are 100 player levels that you can advance through using your ingame balance, which can be earned through use of your [jobs](money.md)!
Each level costs a set amount to rank up to (you can't skip levels by paying an excess) with the `/rankup` command, which will tell you how much you need if you do not yet have enough to rank up! The perks you gain along the way are:

### Commands

##### WonderHaul Accessories:

`/acc` to open your Accessories slots so you can add/remove the accessories you have found during your travels!
>Note that they do not stack - so a +2 Speed and a +1 Speed accessory in the slots won't equal +3 Speed.

##### Hats

`/hat` to put the item/block in your hand on your head as a helmet. Note that not all items/blocks are visible on your head, and your helmet is removed for this (you can take it off the same as any helmet).

##### The Combiner

`/combine` to toggle this on/off (You can do this through the `/util` menu too).

>When enabled this will cause any Glowstone, Redstone, Quartz, Lapis or Coal you pick up to automatically be converted into their respective blocks as you pick them up!

##### Upgraded Elytra

When holding your Elytra in your hand do `/eupgrade`.

To add coal for the fuel right click with the upgraded Elytra in your hand and put the coal in the empty slot (note it cannot be withdrawn after).

To use hold shift when gliding with the upgraded Elytra equipped to activate the jetpack (look up to go up etc...)

##### V.O.I.D.

`/togglevoid` to toggle this on/off (You can do this through the `/util` menu too).

>When enabled this will mean that as you mine and dig any Dirt, Cobble, Sand or Gravel that enters your inventory will be automatically removed/destroyed - allowing you to farm your Mining/Excavation/Jobs for longer without having to empty your inventory! (Note that alternatives do not get removed - such as coarse dirt, andesite/granite/andesite and red sand).

##### Upgraded Elytra Particles

To change the particles do `/eup` to open a GUI and select the particles you want!

##### Chat Titles

You will get new titles as you go up the levels, which you can select/change/disable via the GUI brought up with `/titles`!
A full list of the titles currently added through your player levels can be found [here](titles.md)!
