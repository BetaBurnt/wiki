## Player Shops

Creating a shop is as simple as placing a chest and punching it with the item you wish to sell in your hand while sneaking!<br>
If done correctly it will ask you to type how much to sell one for in the chat, enter it (without a slash, so to sell for $10 just enter 10) to create the shop, then stick the stock in the chest!

To set up a shop that players sell items to do exactly the same as above, and then (whilst looking at the sign on the chest) do `/qs buy`!<br>
Alternatively sneak right click the sign of the shop you own to pull some options up in your chat - simply click the relevant option to change it!

To buy/sell from another players shop simply punch the sign on the front of the chest and enter how many you wish to buy/sell in the chat!<br>
When selling to a shop there must be space left in the chest for the items you are selling (and stock left for buying) - When you punch the sign it will tell you the available stock/space!

If you punch a shop sign and do not want to purchase from/sell to that shop simply walk away from it to cancel!

**Note:**<br>
Some item names will not fit on the sign for the shop, or may not show much details - a prime example being Enhanted Books. However - when you punch the sign to buy/sell it will state what is being sold in full in the chat!

## Player Shop Limits

While you will be able to set shops up as a new player, there are limits to how many shops you can create at a time - this goes up as your [player level](https://legioncraft.co.uk/wiki/levels.html) does!

|**Player Level**|**Player Shop Limit**|
|---|---|
|1-17|10 Shops|
|18-27|15 Shops|
|28-27|20 Shops|
|38-44|25 Shops|
|45-51|30 Shops|
|52-58|35 Shops|
|59-63|40 Shops|
|64-68|45 Shops|
|69+|50 Shops|

**A couple of other small limits to note:**<br>
- The lowest you can sell/buy items for is $2.50 per item. In general, aside from like...dirt... nothing should be set that low anyway. This is mostly to avoid selling/buying for anywhere near as cheaply as the Pawn Shop, but in general be sensible when setting shops up - don't set them stupidly low, it messes with the server economy heavily when doing that or constantly trying to undercut everyone.
- You cannot sell/buy an item through shops for more than $25,000,000 per item - as that's the cap on a players balance!

## Shop Teleports

You can use various commands to allow others to teleport to your shop and to add your shop to a list for all to see.

**PLEASE NOTE::**

**Shop teleports are just for shop use.** 
They are **not** to be used to give public access to villager trades or to mob spawners/grinders - Setting these up for your friends or town members to access is fine, but not for every player on the server to access at any time they like.<br>
These are also **not** to be used as an extra home/warp. 

**Any shop teleports that we find that have been set up where there isn't a shop, or to give public access to spawners/grinders/villager trades, will be removed and warnings will be issued - repeated offenses will result in temporary/permanent bans.**


Commands:
- Set your shop tp where you are and add it to the shops list with `/setpshop`
- Go to your own shop with `/pshop`
- Teleport to another players shop, if they have one, with `/pshop <name>`
- Delete your shop teleport and remove it from the list with `/delpshop` (any set lore for the shop will remain)

- List all shops and click their icon to go to them with `/pshops`
- Set the lore for your shop in this list (colour codes allowed) with `/setpshoplore <1-4> <message>`
**Note that you can't have gaps in the lore lines, so if you enter 3 as the lore line in the command but don't have text in lines 1 or 2 it'll set it in the lowest free space**
- Delete the lore of the set line from your shop in this list with `/delpshoplore <1-4>`
**Note as above, can't have gaps in the lore lines, so if you had 4 lines set and delete line 3 it will move the text in line 4 down to line 3**
- Set the icon for your shop in the shops list to the item in your hand with `/setpshopicon`
**Note - Base item only, no name/lore/enchants etc.. will carry over**

## Admin/Pawn Shop

![admin](images/ashop.png)

There is a shop at spawn (you can use `/pawn` to go straight there) where you can sell some basic items for a low amount when necessary.<br>
Note that this is **not** intended to be a main source of income for anybody, even new players - use [Jobs](money.md), player shops and [auctions](auctions.md) for that!

## Auctions

You can read up on the player auctions [HERE](auctions.md).
