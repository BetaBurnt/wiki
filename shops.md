# Shops

## Player Shops

Creating a shop is as simple as placing a chest and punching it with the item you wish to sell in your hand!
If done correctly it will ask you to type how much to sell one for in the chat, enter it (without a slash, so to sell for $10 just enter 10) to create the shop, then stick the stock in the chest! (Remember not to unlock your shop chests!).
To set up a shop that players sell items to do exactly the same as above, and then (whilst looking at the sign on the chest) do `/qs buy`!

>Note that while a shop selling a mob spawner will be for a specific type (so if you set it up with a skeleton spawner in your hand it won't sell other spawner types even if you put them in the chest) it will only show as `MobSpawner` on the sign - please put a sign above the chest with the name of the spawner being sold!! If you see a shop selling spawners that does not specify which kind ask a staff member to check for you!

To buy/sell from another players shop simply punch the sign on the front of the chest and enter how many you wish to buy/sell in the chat! When selling to a shop there must be space left in the chest for the items you are selling (and stock left for buying) - When you punch the sign it will tell you the available stock/space!


## Shop Teleports

The commands are nice and simple:

- `/setshop` - To set/change where your shop teleport is located
- `/delshop` - To delete your shop teleport
- `/shop [player]` - To teleport to that players shop, or your own if you don't add a name
- `/shops` - To list all currently available shop
