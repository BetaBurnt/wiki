# Tools, Weapons and Armor

Generic tools, weapons and armor will drop from mobs occasionally. These are categorised by their tier, which can be one of the following:

- Junk
- Ordinary
- Unusual
- Rare
- Artifact
- Mysterious

Junk items are mostly useless wooden and stone items that may hold an enchantment occasionally. They can be deconstructed into their raw materials or traded in at the Junkyard for a price. You can also sacrifice them at a Relic or Essence Collector.

Ordinary items are often made out of Iron, Gold and Chainmail, and can hold a few simple enchantments. They may be of some use to newer players starting out, or as a commodity for veterans to use instead of damaging their hard earned items.

Unusual items will usually be made out of Gold and Diamond. They can hold a variety of complex enchantments. They are worth a higher value if traded into the junkyard.

Rare items will often be made out of Diamond. They can hold a larger array of high level enchants, and generally hold a higher value than Unusual Items. Rare shields have a chance to drop with a texture.

Artifact items will always be made out of Diamond. They can hold very high tier enchants, and will always be imbued with a special artifact effect.
