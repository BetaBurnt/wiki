# Locations

## Spawn

The place where it all begins, spawn contains information about the server and many useful features including our good friend [Bonus Bill](https://winterbear.github.io/Legioncraft-Wiki/bonusbill.html)!


## Survival

This is the world you will spend the majority of your time playing (for the non-creative players among us)! Whether that is just living by yourself in a secluded part of the world, or by joining together and making a [town or even a nation](https://winterbear.github.io/Legioncraft-Wiki/towny.html)! You can also use our [DynMap](http://play.legioncraft.co.uk:8668/) to check out this world, and find a place to live!

> Make sure to use the Resources world for mass material gathering, to keep the Survival clean and destruction free!


## The Nether

The nether is as normal on any Minecraft server - you can access it from any portal you create in the Survival world!

> Do not build in this world - it is reset once a month to refresh the fortresses and resources!


## Resource World

This world is entirely for the purpose of gathering materials for your Survival builds/shops etc... 

> Do not build in this world - it is reset once a fortnight so there will never be a shortage of the materials you need!


## The End

You can access the End from any end portal/stronghold found in the Resources world! 

> Do not build in this world - it is reset once a fortnight (Resources one Sunday, the End the next etc..) to bring back the dragon for you to have another go at bagging the dragon egg, and to reset resources and end cities!


## Creative

Here our players are free to use Creative mode and WorldEdit to their disposal. You are able to build massive builds here and really show off your skills in our 200x200 block plots. This world is grief protected and you can only build inside your own plots and plots you have access to.
