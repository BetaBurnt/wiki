# Reporting Issues/Contacting Staff

If you find grief, whether it's your build or not (even if you aren't 100% sure it is grief), please do not fix it yourself! 
Open a report for the staff with the `/grief [message]` command whilst stood next to the relevant area and leave it as it is!
If you wish to report an issue - such as a bug, missing perms or even report a player for something, please use the `/report [message]` command.

Always do as staff tell you - if we ask you to calm down, or take an argument to `/msg` etc... please do so. Ignoring us will result in punishment such as a mute or even a ban.
If you do get banned at any time you can appeal on the forums' [Ban Appeals](http://www.legioncraft.co.uk/home/m/39230198/viewforum/7317014) section for the ban to be lifted!
