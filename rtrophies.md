# Trophies

As you play on the server doing your day to day Minecrafting you will be doing actions that count towards trophies - not that much different to the achievement/trophies you might gain when playing your Playstation or Xbox!

You can view which trophies you have unlocked, when you will unlock the next level of a trophy and what counts towards each trophy with `/case`, which will bring up a GUI like so:

![trophycase](images/trophycase.png) 

In this example I have unlocked the first level of five trophies, and the second level of a sixth - which shows information about the trophy like so:

![trophyinfo](images/trophyinfo.png) 

If you have unlocked a trophy you can click it to get a copy of that trophy to place where you like! The few limits on placed trophies are:
- Each player can only place 1 of each trophy type in a Survival world and 1 in Creative - you cannot place them in the Resource worlds.
- When broken they will simply disappear. You can get another copy any time through your `/case`, however only the latest unlocked level can be summoned! 
(ie if you have upgraded a trophy to Silver level, you can no longer get the Bronze level from the case).
- You cannot place a trophy you have not unlocked yourself - so giving trophy items to other people is pointless.

When a Trophy is placed it will have an item above it that is (in some places very vaguely) related to what the Trophy is for:

And if you click on the Trophy it will swap the item out to show the name of who placed it and what the Trophy was awarded for!

Note that some items don't work with the holograms for some reason... as an example, as shown above, the Playtime Trophy uses a Compass, not a Clock... because I can't get Clock to work!
