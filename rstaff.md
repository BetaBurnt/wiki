# Reporting Issues/Contacting Staff

If you find grief and want to know who did it (whether that be so you can get your own back - in a civil manner - or to know who to boot from your town) you can do so by standing next to the grief and doing `/grief [message]`. When staff have checked this they will let you know (they will `/mail` you who it was if you were not online at the time).
If you wish to report an issue - such as a bug, missing perms or even report a player for something, please use the `/report [message]` command.

Always do as staff tell you - if we ask you to calm down, or take an argument to `/msg` etc... please do so. Ignoring us will result in punishment such as a mute or even a ban.
If you do get banned at any time you can appeal on the forums' Ban Appeals section for the ban to be lifted!
