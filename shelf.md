# Bookshelf Storage

You can create a 9 slot storage in any bookshelf you have placed, lock/unlock it and give access to other players when it's locked!

The commands for this feature are (all require looking at the bookshelf it's for):
- `/bshelf set` to create a 9 slot storage in the target bookshelf.
- `/bshelf lock` to lock the target bookshelf so that only you (and staff) have access to it, along with those you grant access to.
- `/bshelf grant <player>` to give the named player access to the locked bookshelf you are looking at.
- `/bshelf revoke <player>` to remove the named players access from your locked bookshelf.
- `/bshelf check` to check who you have given access to (only works on a locked shelf you own).
- `/bshelf remove` to remove the bookshelf (the storage, not the block). Stored items in the shelf will be put straight into your inventory, or dropped where you are if you don't have space. Alternatively - break the bookshelf.
