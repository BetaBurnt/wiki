## Spawn

The place where it all begins, spawn contains information about the server and some useful features if you look about!


## Survival

This is the world you will spend the majority of your time playing (for the non-creative players among us)! 
Whether that is just living by yourself in a secluded part of the world, or by joining together and making a [town or even a nation](https://legioncraft.co.uk/wiki/towny.html)!

Please be aware that for those living outside of towns, griefing is likely to happen - Make sure to lock your valuables away and hide your property well!
Joining or creating a town will allow you to build on claimed land that cannot be griefed (at least not by people not in your town) and gain a number of abilities in that land and more!

> Make sure to use the Resource worlds for mass material gathering, to keep the Survival worlds clean and destruction free!

### Survival Nether

The nether is as normal on any Minecraft server - you can access it from any portal you create in the Survival world!

Unlike the Resource Nether this world is permanent so if you wish to live in the nether this is the world to do so! As with Survival however, be aware that grief is allowed!


## Resource World

This world is entirely for the purpose of gathering materials for your Survival builds/shops etc... 

> Do not build in this world - it is reset once a fortnight so there will never be a shortage of the materials you need!

### Resource Nether

You can access this world from any nether portal built in the Resource world and can dig away to your hearts content for nether-related materials!

> Do not build in this world - it is reset once a month to refresh the fortresses and resources!

### The End

You can access the End from any end portal/stronghold found in the Resource world! 
This world is reset once every 3 weeks, and accessible only for a week when it resets, to bring back the dragon for you to have another go at bagging the dragon egg, and to reset resources and end cities!

> Do not build in this world


## Creative

Here our players are free to use Creative mode and WorldEdit to their disposal. 
You are able to build massive builds here and really show off your skills in our 200x200 block plots. 

This world is grief protected and you can only build inside your own plots and plots you have access to.

Please note that while you can access the Creative world straight away, and build on other players' plots, you cannot claim your own plot until you reach player level 5 and cannot use WorldEdit in this world until player level 15!
