# Getting Married


You can now marry another player, and even divorce them! Marriages are performed by a staff member, and it will cost both players $2500 each to get married (Divorces are free)!

When married you will have a few extra perks:

- Your natural regeneration will be a little faster when near your spouse.
- You will be able to insta-TP to your spouse with `/mtp`.
- You will be able to send an item to your spouse without needing to throw it at them! To do so hold the item and do `/mgift` - Does not work if one of the two players is in Creative!
- You will be able to enable/disable PvP with your spouse with `/mpvp on` and `/mpvp off`.
- You will be able to kiss your spouse by standing within 2 blocks, then both crouch and right click - You will see particles!
