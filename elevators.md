# Elevators


Want to build an elevator to another floor, rather than try and fit in stairs or use ladders? Easy!

All you need to do this is some redstone blocks and a bloc/slab that is valid for elevators!

It is then a simple matter of placing the elevator block/slab where you want it, with a redstone block nderneath. A maximum distance of 36 blocks can be between each, you can have blocks between them but the space above the elevators themselves (where you would be stood) must be clear!

To go up and down it is a simple matter of jumping on the block to go up, and pressing sneak to go down!

## Valid Elevator Blocks/Slabs

You can use any wool block or any slab (placed in the lower location ontop of the redstone block), 

## Extra Information

You can also add a bit of customization - An elevator block will only take you to another of the same block/slab!

For example:

If I stand on the white elevator blocks at the bottom and jump, it will take me to the third floor, as it is the next one with white elevator blocks!
