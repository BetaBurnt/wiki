# Elevators

Want to build an elevator to another floor, rather than try and fit in stairs or use ladders? Easy!

All you need to do this is some coloured wool and enderpearls! You can craft an elevator block with 8 wool of the same colour, and 1 enderpearl:

It is then a simple matter of placing one above the other. A maximum distance of 64 blocks can be between each, you can have blocks between them but the space above the elevators themselves (where you would be stood) must be clear!

To go up and down it is a simple matter of jumping on the block to go up, and pressing sneak to go down! (Similar to the elevators in the OpenBlocks mod).

You can also add a bit of customization - An elevator block will only take you to another of the same colour!

For example:

If I stand on the white elevator blocks at the bottom and jump, it will take me to the third floor, as it is the next one with white elevator blocks!
