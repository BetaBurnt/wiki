## Main Menu

You can access the main GUI with `/menu`

## Utilities

You can get to this from either the `/menu` or by using `/util` directly, and it will give you this

![util25](https://i.gyazo.com/2f753a4248e6301765bd0f72a306a42d.png)



This has also meant a few other menus have had to be made too - Disguises and Bow Particles!

### Disguises Menu

![util26](https://i.gyazo.com/777c53dcca2065b9568f1957e9e07f28.png)

You can click any of the mobs you have paid for to enable the disguise, and your skull in the bottom right to remove the disguise (and a button to return to the `/util` menu in the corner).

Note that currently this does not support alternatives to the disguises, such as baby forms etc...

### Bow Particles Menu

![util27](https://i.gyazo.com/8f7fc9eff2a496e3b41ebf52eacf160c.png)

As above, click the particle you wish to use to select it - The skull in the bottom right toggles them on/off!
Note that the netherstar in the top right will currently only be there for CatTurtleDog200 as this is their custom particles they won in the last build competition!
This can also be accessed with `/bowmenu`

## V.O.I.D.

This is the Very Ordinary Item Destroyer. For those of you from ATC, this is essentially the Soulfire MKII!
This can be unlocked for use at any time when you get to level 70, and can be toggled from the `/util` menu!
For those not yet at level 70 - you can purchase temporary usage of this through the `/tokenshop` - 10 tokens gets you 1 day of use!

When enabled this will mean that as you mine and dig any Dirt, Cobble, Sand or Gravel that enters your inventory will be automatically removed/destroyed - allowing you to farm your Mining/Excavation/Jobs for longer without having to empty your inventory! (Note that alternatives do not get removed - such as coarse dirt, andesite/granite/andesite and red sand).

## The Combiner

This is unlocked at level 20 and goes hand in hand with V.O.I.D.! When enabled this will cause any Glowstone, Redstone, Quartz, Lapis or Coal you pick up to automatically be converted into their respective blocks as you pick them up! 

## Item Magnet

Unlocked at level 35, with this enabled, any item drops within 8 blocks of you will be pulled towards you! This will work alongside the VOID and Combiner features!

Toggling this will close the utilities menu on click unlike the other toggles, as it doesn't register the change of whether it has been enabled or disabled otherwise (due to '/magnet' not working, it has to be '/magnet on/off')
EG: if it didn't close you'd click once to enable, and click again to get a message saying it's already enabled, but if you closed the menu and opened it again it would disable it as it should..... xD

Abusing this as a means to steal item drops from other players will result in a ban for abuse - If you have it enabled and accidentally pick someone elses stuff up, return it (In general maybe just disable it if you're playing near other people!).
