# McRPG Skill - Sorcery

This skill will give you access to various abilities and buffs of a magic/alchemical nature!

## How To Increase Your Sorcery Level?
Brew up a load of potions!

## McRPG Custom Brewing GUI

![mcbrew](images/mcbrew.png)

In order to efficiently work with brewing, including adding new potions correctly - McRPG replaces the brewing GUI with it's own custom GUI.

This works mostly exactly the same as a normal Vanilla brewing GUI. Put your fuel in the top left slot, your bottles in the three empty slots and your ingredient in the top middle slot.

The left column will show you the % left of the fuel item that is currently in use, and the right column will show you the % of the brew time there is left before the brew is complete. Any Artifacts you gain (which has a small chance per brew event) will appear in the 4 purple slots at the bottom.

## Artifacts

These are items you can gain while brewing. Each Artifact has a different use:<br>
- **Redeemable XP** - Use it to redeem XP against any Skill<br>
- **Skill Specific XP** - Use to boost a specific Skills XP<br>
- **Redeemable Level** - Flat 1 level boost to any Skill<br>
- **Ability Point** - Gain 1 Ability Point<br>
- **Unlock Book Summon** - Use to summon an Ability Unlock Book<br>
- **Upgrade Book Summon** - Use to summon an Upgrade Ability Book<br>
- **Cooldown Reset**- Reset any cooldowns you have active for your skills/abilities, 1-5 uses<br>
- **Magnet** - Pull items towards you in a range of 5-12, with 15-50 uses<br>

In theory yes - these artifacts should be sellable/auctionable if you don't want to use them yourself. If they are - **great use for the auction house - hint, hint.**
