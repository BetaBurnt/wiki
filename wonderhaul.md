## About the plugin

> Note that not all the following content has been added to Legioncraft, and may be subject to change

Wonderhaul is an upcoming loot based plugin that will be added to Legioncraft in 1.11/1.12. These features have been worked on for the past few months, and while many are ready, some are still yet to be completed. Please keep in mind we want the best loot system we can have so we are open to suggestions, but we have to make sure what we do is possible in a reasonable time frame.
