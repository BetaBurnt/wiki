# McRPG Skill - Taming

This skill will give you access to various abilities and buffs when taking tamed Wolves with you on your adventures!

## How To Increase Your Taming Level?
Take Wolves into battle with you!

## Call of the Wild

This is an ability that all players will be able to use, regardless of their Taming level.<br>
It allows you to summon tamed animals when you're having a hard time finding natural animals to tame - if you have the items to do so!

To summon an animal just hold the required items, sneak and right click. The animals you can summon are:
|Animal|Required Items|
|---|---|
|Wolf|10x Bones|
|Cat|10x Cod|
|Horse|10x Apples|
|Parrot|10x Feathers|
|Tropical Fish|10x Prismarine Shards|

Note that while these summoned animals won't despawn you cannot summon endlessly, and these animals cannot be bred.

## What is the Taming Skills Default Ability?

### **Gore**.

This gives you a chance to inflict Bleed on a mob/player when your tamed Wolves attack them (Bleed modifiers from the Sword abilities Bleed+, Deeper Wound and Vampire work with this).<br>

An entity with Bleed will take damage over time for a short period - however, it cannot kill them.<br>
When a player has been inflicted with Bleed they will have a short period of time after it wears off where they cannot be inflicted with Bleed again.

The chances of Bleed being inflicted goes up as your Taming level goes up.

## Unlockable Taming Passive Abilities

These abilities just need to be in your active loudout for their effects to be active.

## Extra for Taming

### Crystallized Blood

When a wolf kills a mob, there is a chance for it to drop blood (increased chance if bleeding). 
These can be put on tools, weapons and armor to increase exp gained when using them! **However** - This also makes them unstable and has a low chance of breaking on use. 

There is also a rare Blood Curse that can drop. Attack a player with it to silence them and prevent all abilities from being activated for a few seconds.
