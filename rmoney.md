# Money and Jobs

To check your own balance use `/balance`, `/bal` or `/money` (add another player name after to check theirs, eg: `/bal BurntValentine`).
To give money to another player use `/pay [player] [amount]`.

The main ways to earn money on the server are via [player shops](shops.md), [auctions](auctions.md) or Jobs - as the first two have other pages dedicated to them this page will explain Jobs!

## Money Limits

Your player balance is capped at $25,000,000 - so make sure you start spending that dough when you're approaching the limit!

## Jobs

The easiest way to make money on the server is to get a couple of jobs so that you earn money whilst playing on the server! You can join up to 2 jobs at a time.<br>
Please note that if you leave one and join another the old job is reset to level 1!

Some jobs should be looked at as a 'Main' job - those that are generally the more common actions and/or are the most farmable (Digger, Miner, Woodcutter, Farmer, Hunter, WitchHunter, Fisherman) - and some other jobs should generally be seen as a 'Secondary' job as they are not what you will likely be doing most of the time but they likely compliment another job.<br>
For example:
- Blacksmith works well with Miner.
- Cook works well with Farmer.
- Brewer and Enchanter work well with the Hunter jobs.
- Blacksmith and Enchanter, while both generally classed as a secondary job, would also work well together.
- Hunter and WitchHunter could also be considered a secondary job to each other as well.

Handyman could work in either aspect as a main or a secondary job as it fills in gaps the other jobs (mostly) lack.

Which job is `the best` is entirely down to what you are doing on the server - don't just ask people what earns the most money as their responses are also entirely down to their own jobs and what they've put time into.<br>
FOr example if they have only ever gotten Miner to a higher level, because they spend a lot of time mining in their play style, then they'll say Miner and that other jobs aren't worthwhile, when in reality if you put the effort into any of the jobs they will pay out just as well as each other in the long run.

As a general rule when picking jobs what we would advise you to do is `think about what you enjoy doing the most on the server and don't mind grinding, or pick a main job and keep the secondary to reflect what you're actively doing on the server at the time`.

Planning a player shop around what you will be gaining/making via your jobs - particularly if it's stuff nobody else or not many others have shops for - would also be a good idea.

**Please Note:** 
While not often unless required, Jobs may undergo tweaks at any time to try and make them more balanced for all players on the server and so everyone isn't always using the same job because it `earns more` (which is a fallacy anyway, it depends entirely on what you want to grind and level up).<br>**
**However - these will mostly be tweaks to the money and XP values for the jobs, rather than changes to the jobs themselves. These changes will always be noted on the server Discord if/when they are made.**

Any changes to the jobs themselves, such as adding/removing jobs or what they allow you to earn for doing, will be posted on the Discord/Forums prior to it happening so that it is open for discussion first!

### Job Commands

To view the available jobs ingame do `/jobs browse` and then `/jobs info [job name]` to see what you get paid for by that job!
To join a job `/jobs join [job]`
To leave a job use `/jobs leave [job]`
To check your stats, and how much job exp you need to get to the next job level use `/jobs stats` (when you are in a job `/jobs info [job]` will be updated for the prices you get at your job level!).
