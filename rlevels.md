# Levels

Each player has two ladders they can climb on the server - their [server rank](ranks.md) and their player level!

There are 100 player levels that you can advance through using your ingame balance, which can be earned through use of your [jobs](money.md)!
Each level costs a set amount to rank up to (you can't skip levels by paying an excess) with the `/levelup` command, which will tell you how much you need if you do not yet have enough to rank up! 

The perks you gain along the way are:
