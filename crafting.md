# Miscellaneous

- You can craft any block of wool back into 3 string!
- You can craft any netherwart block back into 9 netherwart!
- You can craft a Quartz Block (only plain quartz blocks) back into 3 quartz.
- Prismarine can be smelted into Prismarine Bricks (along with their normal crafting recipe).
- Dark Prismarine can be crafted from 4 Prismarine Bricks (along with their normal crafting recipe).
- Ink Sacs can be crafted with a clay ball and either a piece of coal or charcoal (due to the less frequent spawning of Squid now there are other sea critters).
- Smooth Stone from smelting Stone has been added (as it is only actually a thing in 1.14+ normally).
- Smooth Quartz from smelting plain Quartz Blocks has been added (again, normally a 1.14+ thing - note that smooth quartz looks like normal quartz in 1.13.2 without texture packs).
- 8 Concrete Powder of the same colour around an Ice Block = 8 Concrete of the same colour.
- 4 Bones in a 2x2 square will give you 1 Bone Block (loss compared to Vanilla bonemeal > bone block, but less steps to make and less inventory space to mass produce bone blocks).
